== Description ==

JWPlayer Panel registers a meta box in your Post Writing Panel, where you enter your video title/url/thumbnail, and get those displayed automatically before the post content using the official JWPlayer ( Must be installed prior to using this plugin ).

= Important Note: =
**JW Player Plugin for WordPress** must be installed prior to installing this plugin, JWPlayer Panel only integrates with it, does not embed the SWF player on its own.
And that is because of the flexibility and options it does provide, that makes it a waste of time to replicate such features while they exist already.

= Customization =
You can customize the player skin, and look and feel from the **JW Player Plugin for Wordpress**, and this plugin, JWPlayer Panel, will use the default customization set.

== Installation ==

Make sure you installed **JW Player Plugin for Wordpress** first, before proceeding with the following instruction.

1. Upload `gr80-jwplayer-plugin-helper-panel.zip` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory

4. Navigate to 'New Post' or 'New Page'
5. Fill in the fields under 'JWPlayer Panel' title

7. Customize the player as you wish from **JW Player Plugin for Wordpress** options page
8. Voila! See you video/audio by previewing the post/page you've just created!
